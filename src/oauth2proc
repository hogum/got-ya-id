1. call /api/auth/google -> Get an authentication url
2. Browse the given url -> Will open a page asking the user to sign in/ authenticate their
   google account / give access
3. If user accepts, the callback url /api/auth/callback is automatically called in the browser
   This returns the access token to be used to register the user.

4. Using that access token, call api/auth/register/social
   This will create a new account if the user doesn't exist, but make no changes if they do
   So it can also be called for sign ins

Alternatively, this can be done in the frontend: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web

Actually, at step 3, add code to redirect the request call step 4 instead of giving a respose


Actually no, just listen to the current URL on the frontend, if it matches the callback </one>,
call it yourself, get the token, ,then call the registration one yourself
